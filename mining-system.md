# Mining — AI Platform for Final Year Project Students

---

## 1. What Is Mining?

Mining is an AI-powered platform designed specifically for undergraduate and graduate final year students. It helps them write proper project documentation and build real, working AI software prototypes — so their projects are no longer just reports sitting on a shelf.

The core idea: a student comes in with a project idea, Mining helps them research it, document it, and then turn it into something that actually works.

## 2. The Problem It Solves

Every year, thousands of final year students want to incorporate software and AI into their projects. The problem is they don't know how, don't have the time to learn, and end up submitting long written reports that are theoretically interesting but practically useless. The work never leaves the paper.

This creates three pain points:

- Students spend weeks writing documentation they barely understand
- Projects have no working prototype to demonstrate or validate the idea
- Supervisors and institutions accept this because there is no better option

Mining fixes all three.

## 3. Who It Is For

**Primary users:** Final year undergraduate students across engineering, computer science, health sciences, business, and any field where projects are required.

**Secondary users:** Postgraduate students doing research projects or dissertations who need a research foundation and prototype quickly.

## 4. How It Works (User Flow)

### Step 1 — Project Discovery
The student opens Mining and either:
- Types their project idea in plain language, or
- Browses the built-in research library of past projects, papers, and academic references

Mining then pulls relevant literature, related projects, and validated references to form the foundation of the work.

### Step 2 — Documentation Generation
Using the gathered research, Mining drafts the full project documentation including:
- Title and abstract
- Problem statement
- Literature review with real citations
- Methodology
- Expected outcomes
- References list

This works similarly to how NotebookLM generates summaries and insights from sources — but Mining goes further by structuring everything into a formal academic document template.

### Step 3 — Prototype Selection
Once the documentation is ready, Mining asks:

> *"Would you like to build a prototype for this project?"*

The student picks from three output types:

| Output Type | Best For |
|---|---|
| AI Software Prototype | Apps, prediction tools, classifiers, chatbots |
| CAD / Engineering Simulation | Mechanical, civil, or hardware designs |
| Diagram & Automation Flow | Business systems, process automation, workflows |

### Step 4 — Prototype Generation
Mining builds a working, minimal prototype based on the project idea. For AI projects this means a functional tool the student can demo. For engineering it means a simulation or technical diagram. The prototype validates that the idea is real and testable — not just theoretical.

## 5. Key Features

**Research Library**
A curated and continuously updated database of academic papers, past student projects, datasets, and references organized by field and topic. No more "I couldn't find references."

**Documentation Engine**
AI that writes structured academic documents using the student's input and the research library. It follows standard final year project formats and can be customized per institution.

**Prototype Builder**
The differentiator. Mining converts a documented project idea into a working prototype — either AI software, a CAD model, or an automation diagram — without requiring the student to write a single line of code.

**Validation Layer**
After the prototype is built, Mining runs a basic validation to confirm the idea is feasible and the prototype behaves as expected. This gives students confidence to defend their work.

## 6. What Makes Mining Different

Most tools help students write better. Mining helps students **build** better.

The closest comparison is NotebookLM, which is excellent at summarizing research and generating documentation. Mining does that too — but then it takes the next step that no other student tool currently takes: turning that documentation into a working prototype.

The gap Mining fills is between *"I have an idea and a report"* and *"I have an idea, a report, and something that works."*

## 7. Business Model

Mining charges students directly at an affordable cost. Pricing is structured so it is accessible to individual students while still being sustainable.

**Suggested pricing tiers:**

- **Free Tier** — Basic documentation drafts, limited library access, no prototype
- **Student Plan** — Full documentation engine + one prototype build per month (~$10–15/month or one-time project fee)
- **Institution License** — Universities or departments pay for bulk student access, Mining becomes an official project tool

The one-time project fee model is likely the strongest entry point — a student pays once to complete their project, similar to how they would pay for printing or binding.

## 8. The Architecture (High Level, No Code)

Mining is built around four connected layers:

**Layer 1 — Research Intelligence**
Connects to academic databases (open access journals, past project repositories, curated datasets). Uses AI to retrieve and rank relevant sources based on the student's topic.

**Layer 2 — Document Intelligence**
Takes the retrieved research and the student's inputs, then uses a language model to generate structured academic documents. The output matches standard final year project formats.

**Layer 3 — Prototype Intelligence**
Interprets the documented project idea and routes it to the correct builder — AI prototype engine, CAD simulation tool, or workflow/diagram generator. Each builder produces a minimal working output.

**Layer 4 — Validation & Export**
Runs basic checks on the prototype, flags any gaps between the documentation and what was built, and exports everything in formats students can submit or present.

## 9. What Mining Is Not

- It is not a cheating tool. It helps students build and validate real ideas, not copy existing work.
- It is not a replacement for the student's thinking. The student still defines the problem and evaluates the output.
- It is not only for computer science students. Any student with a project that benefits from software, simulation, or automation can use it.

## 10. Why Now

AI tools have matured to the point where generating working software prototypes from natural language descriptions is genuinely possible. The student market is underserved — most AI tools target professionals or developers. Final year students are a high-volume, recurring, and motivated user base with a clear and urgent need. Every academic year produces a new cohort.

The infrastructure exists. The need exists. Mining connects them.

## 11. Next Steps for Development

1. Define the research library structure and identify open-access academic sources to index
2. Build the documentation engine with a small set of field templates (engineering, CS, business, health)
3. Develop the AI software prototype builder as the first prototype output type (highest demand)
4. Test with a small cohort of real final year students and iterate on the workflow
5. Add CAD and automation diagram outputs as the platform scales
6. Approach universities and departments for institutional licensing conversations
